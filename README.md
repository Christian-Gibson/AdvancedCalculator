# AdvancedCalculator
A more advanced version of my earlier calculator, made with C# and XAML (WPF).


- This version of the calculator includes number buttons on the application, a percent button, and more buttons to come.

- Operands and the result are converted from strings into doubles, with the corresponding operation buttons determining which operation is performed on the doubles.

- Updates to come: -/+ button, multiple operand operations, memory button, backspace button.
